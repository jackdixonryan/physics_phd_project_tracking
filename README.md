Tracking an Ambition

## The Central Issue
I am still undereducated with regards to mathematics and physics. I need to learn so much more! My background so far includes 

### Courses
- Classical Physics from Professor Dave Explains (4.5 lecture hours)
- Mathematics from Professor Dave Explains (22 lecture hours)
- 2 Undergraduate astronomy courses.

### Readings 
- Feynman's Lectures on Physics, lectures 1 - 13 (slow going)
- Einstein's Fridge (Thermodynamics)
- Black Hole Survival Guide

As you can see, in the last year of learning (and working problem sets took a long time, I guarantee, but all the same) I have attained at least a working substrate of knowledge to support a push to a higher education. It is barely a start, to be perfectly honest. Much, much more needs to happen. 

Some formalization would help me a lot.
